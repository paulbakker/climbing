Lover's Leap, located near South Lake Tahoe in California, is my favorite place to climb.
I like it better than Yosemite. 

So what makes Lover's Leap so special?
Keep reading and find out.

What you'll find
-----

Lover's Leap is an impressive looking, 500ft or so, almost vertical granite wall that hosts many multi pitch trad climbs. 
What makes it great is the combination of most climbs being in the 5.7-5.10 range and a super easy 10 minute walk-off.
Although most routes are trad, the climbing typically requires a combination of face climbing and crack climbing skills.
The unique characteristic of the climbing are the many horizontal dikes.
These dikes, depending on their size, make great hand holds, or a good stance.
This keeps the difficulty in check, while you get all the exposure of a near vertical granite wall.

Better than Yosemite!?

Ok, it probably depends.
Yosemite defintetely has way more impressive walls, and some of the best scenic views in the world. 
There are also way more climbs to be found in the Valley.
If you're a 5.13 trad climber, there isn't a lot to do at Lover's Leap, and you probably want to be big walling some of the world famous routes on El Cap instead.
I'm not a 5.13 trad climber though, and neither are most weekend warriors.

There are many great lower great climbs in Yosemite as well, but this is where Lover's Leap has an edge. 
The routes at Lover's Leap often feel steeper, but because of the dikes still within lower grades and easy to protect.
Most climbs are 3-4 pitches, and within 10 minutes you're back at the base to rope up for the next route.
This makes it easy to tick 3-4 climbs a day (~12 pitches).
